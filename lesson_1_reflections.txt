How did viewing a diff between two versions
of a file help you see the bug that was
introduced?

The bug could only be in a changed line
becaused it worked before the changes.
So the FC command reduced the search
area.

============================================

How could having easy access to the entire
history of a file make you a more efficient
programmer in the long term?

It can easyly revert buggy files to a state
when they still worked. 

===========================================

What do you think are the pros and cons of
manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The pros are, that I can bundle my changes
into a commit, so that only logcal tasks in
one commit. On the other hand, choosing 
when to commit opens the way for human 
error and the commits can become too large
or too small.

===========================================

Why do you thinksome version control systems,
like Git, allow multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each
file seperately?

Because when writing a programm the files 
depend on each other. Text dosc mostly don't.

===========================================

How can you use the commands git log and
git diff to view the history of files?

You can easily find which lines were changed
for specific changes and can find errors 
more quickly.

===========================================

How might using version control make you
more confident to make changes that could
break something?

With version control you can't break
anything, because you can always go back
to the prevois versions of your code.

===========================================

Now that you have your workspace set up,
what do you want to try using Git for?

The version control of my android projects.
