What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

The current path is declared a repository.
It is neccessary for git to know that this 
path is now a repository. 

===============================================

How is the staging area different from the
working directory and the respository? What
value do you think it offers?

The staging are is a kind of parking space
between the working directory and the repository.
Here you can choose which files you want to 
commit, before you actually execute the commit. 
It is practically, because sometimes you have
experimantal files you do not want to commit.
